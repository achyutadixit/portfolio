        <h2>👋 About Me</h2>

        <p>
            I am a CSE undergraduate at ABV-IIITM Gwalior with a strong interest in competitive programming and full-stack web development.
            I’m currently building and breaking things with PostgreSQL, Node.js, Express, React, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, leveling up every day by solving algorithmic problems and stacking modern tech skills.
        </p>
              
    


    
        <h2>🛠 Skills</h2>
        <h3>Full Stack Web Development</h3>

        <p>I build complete, production-style web applications using modern frontend and backend technologies with clean and scalable architecture. On the frontend, I work with React to develop responsive, component-based user interfaces using HTML5 and CSS3, focusing on usability, performance, and clean UI structure.</p>

        <p>On the backend, I use Node.js and Express to design RESTful APIs, manage routing, middleware, authentication, and secure request handling while following modular coding practices for scalability and maintainability.</p>

        <p>For data storage, I work with PostgreSQL, designing normalized relational schemas, using joins, indexes, constraints, and transactions to ensure data consistency, integrity, and efficient query performance.</p>

        <p>I use Git and GitHub for version control, following clean commit practices and structured workflows to manage features, fixes, and deployments effectively.</p>

        <h3>Competitive Programming</h3>
        
        <p>I actively practice data structures and algorithms to strengthen logical thinking and problem-solving skills. Competitive programming helps me analyze constraints, write optimized code, and develop efficient solutions under time limits.</p>
    
    

        <h2>🎓 Education</h2>
        <h3>B.Tech in Computer Science & Engineering — ABV-IIITM Gwalior</h3>

        <p>Currently pursuing my undergraduate degree with a focus on core computer science fundamentals including data structures, algorithms, operating systems, databases, and software engineering. Alongside academics, I actively explore modern development tools and technologies to build practical projects and strengthen real-world problem-solving skills.</p>
        <h3>CBSE — Class XII</h3>

        <p>Completed senior secondary education with a strong foundation in mathematics and science, which helped develop analytical thinking, logical reasoning, and problem-solving abilities essential for engineering studies.</p>
        <h3>Cambridge IGCSE</h3>

        <p>Completed secondary education under the Cambridge curriculum, gaining early exposure to structured problem-solving, conceptual learning, and an international academic framework that shaped strong fundamentals in computing and mathematics.   </p>
